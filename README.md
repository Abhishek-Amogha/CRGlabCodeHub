# CRGlabCodeHub

Welcome to the CRGlabCodeHub! This repository serves as a collaborative space for sharing code, improving efficiency, and fostering innovation within our lab community. 

## Advantages of Collaboration

- **Code Sharing**: Members can share their code, making it accessible to everyone in the lab.
- **Collaboration**: Working together allows us to combine our strengths and expertise.
- **Improvement and Efficiency**: By using each other's code, we can improvise and enhance functionality, leading to more and more efficient solutions with time.
- **Issue Flagging**: Members can flag issues, which helps in identifying and resolving problems quickly, benefiting the entire community.

## Maintainers

I am currently the maintainer of this repository, a role I have chosen for myself. Future maintainers will be selected by the lab members. The maintainer may change if the current maintainer is no longer the active member of lab or over any dispute. 

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Readme Files**: Everyone is encouraged to write README files for their code. At a minimum, please write or get an AI generated README to provide essential information about your code.
- **Code Comments**: Ensure that comments are added to your code for better readability. (If you have not written comments in your code, Kindly get AI generated comments to clarify your code's functionality)
- **Project Header**: Each project README should be headed with the names of the contributors, formatted in a way that reflects authorship. (contribution(s) in descending order)

## Important Note

While this repository is hosted under my profile, it does not imply that the entire project is solely my work. It is so because it was my idea, and I took the initiative to create it. I encourage everyone to contribute and feel free to submit pull requests (even to modify the README file).

Thank you for being a part of CRGlabCodeHub! Let's collaborate and innovate together!
