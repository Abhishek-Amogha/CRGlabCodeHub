# Auto Extract All Densities
**S. Abhishek**  



This script automates the extraction of density data from `.edr` files generated by GROMACS simulations. It recursively searches for all `.edr` files in the current directory, processes them to extract density information, and saves the results as `.xvg` files in a specified directory.

## Features:
- Recursively searches for `.edr` files.
- Extracts density data using `gmx energy`.
- Skips energy minimization `.edr` files (e.g., `em.edr`).
- Saves the density data as `.xvg` files in a target directory.
- Sends a notification once the process is complete.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository:


2. Run the script:

```bash
   ./process_densities.sh
````

3. Replace `gmx` with `gmx_mpi` if running on Phi or similar high-performance computing environments:

   ```bash
   sed -i 's/gmx/gmx_mpi/' process_densities.sh
   ```

## Requirements:

* GROMACS (`gmx` or `gmx_mpi` for MPI-enabled systems)
* `expect` tool for automating the GROMACS energy extraction

## Notes:

* The script skips files named `em.edr` (energy minimization steps).
* The output files are saved in a directory named `InfoDensity`.
* A notification will be displayed once all files are processed.
